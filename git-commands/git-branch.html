    <p>When working on a project, we add features as we progress on it, and sometimes those features break our layout or code that was functioning without issues up to that moment <strong>if we work on a single branch</strong>.</p>

    <h2>What are Git Branches?</h2>
    <p>Git Branches allow us to work on different versions of our code simultaneously. Think of branches as alternative timelines.</p>
    <p>Git Branches allow us to create separate contexts where we can try new things or even work on multiple ideas in parallel without risking the codebase.</p>
    <p>If we make changes on one branch, they do not impact the other branches until we merge or integrate the changes.</p>

    <h2>The Master Branch</h2>
    <p>In Git, we are always working on a branch. The default branch name is master (or main).</p>
    <p>The master branch is not special in any way or has any superpowers. From Gitâ€™s perspective, the master branch is just like any other branch, and it does not even need to hold the master copy of your project.</p>
    <p>Many people designate the master branch as their official branch for their codebase, but that is left to you to decide.</p>  
    <p>You can list your existing branches with the command </p>
<p><em>$ git branch</em></p>
<p>Look for the *, which indicates the branch you are currently on.</p>
