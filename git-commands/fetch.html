    <h1>Fetch Command</h1>

    <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>git-fetch - Download objects and refs from another repository</p>

    <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

    <p>
       <pre class="content">
        git fetch [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;repository&gt; [&lt;refspec&gt;…​]]
        git fetch [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;group&gt;
        git fetch --multiple [&lt;options&gt;] [(&lt;repository&gt; | &lt;group&gt;)…​]
        git fetch --all [&lt;options&gt;]
       </pre>
    </p>

    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>
            Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated (see the description of <refspec> below for ways to control this behavior).
            By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that you are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using the --tags or --no-tags options or by configuring remote.<name>.tagOpt. By using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly, you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested in as well.
            git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository or URL, or from several repositories at once if <group> is given and there is a remotes.<group> entry in the configuration file. (See git-config[1]).
            When no remote is specified, by default the <code>origin</code> remote will be used, unless there’s an upstream branch configured for the current branch.
            The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object names they point at, are written to <code>.git/FETCH_HEAD</code>. This information may be used by scripts or other git commands, such as git-pull[1].
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>--all</strong><br>
        Fetch all remotes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>-a</strong><br>
        <strong>--append</strong><br>
        Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing contents of <code>.git/FETCH_HEAD</code>. Without this option old data in <code>.git/FETCH_HEAD</code> will be overwritten.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>--atomic</strong><br>
        Use an atomic transaction to update local refs. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>--depth=&lt;depth&gt;</strong><br>
        Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of each remote branch history. If fetching to a shallow repository created by <code>git clone</code> with <code>--depth=&lt;depth&gt;</code> option (see git-clone[1]), deepen or shorten the history to the specified number of commits. Tags for the deepened commits are not fetched.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>--deepen=&lt;depth&gt;</strong><br>
        Similar to --depth, except it specifies the number of commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each remote branch history.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>--shallow-since=&lt;date&gt;</strong><br>
        Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to include all reachable commits after &lt;date&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>--shallow-exclude=&lt;revision&gt;</strong><br>
        Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag. This option can be specified multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>--unshallow</strong><br>
        If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow repositories.<br>
        If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so that the current repository has the same history as the source repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>--update-shallow</strong><br>
        By default when fetching from a shallow repository, git fetch refuses refs that require updating <code>.git/shallow</code>. This option updates .git/shallow and accepts such refs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>--negotiation-tip=&lt;commit|glob&gt;</strong><br>
        By default, Git will report, to the server, commits reachable from all local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce the size of the to-be-received packfile. If specified, Git will only report commits reachable from the given tips. This is useful to speed up fetches when the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with the upstream ref being fetched.<br>
        This option may be specified more than once; if so, Git will report commits reachable from any of the given commits.<br>
        The argument to this option may be a glob on ref names, a ref, or the (possibly abbreviated) SHA-1 of a commit. Specifying a glob is equivalent to specifying this option multiple times, one for each matching ref name.
